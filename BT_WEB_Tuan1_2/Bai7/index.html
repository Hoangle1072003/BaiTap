          <img class="image" src="./img/img.png" alt="" />A smile is a facial
          expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the
          mouth. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner
          of the eyes, an action known as a Duchenne smile. Among humans, a
          smile expresses delight, sociability, happiness, joy, or amusement. It
          is distinct from a similar but usually involuntary expression of
          anxiety known as a grimace. Although cross-cultural studies have shown
          that smiling is a means of communication throughout the world,[1]
          there are large differences among different cultures, religions, and
          societies, with some using smiles to convey confusion or
          embarrassment.
